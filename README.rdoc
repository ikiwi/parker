Runs best on chrome.

There are two roles: parking-searchers and parking-holders.  This app would match parking-searchers and parking holders in the following way:
1. allows holder of a parking space to communicate the position, on google map, of the space that they will be vacating,
2. allows searcher to find available vacating parking spaces.
